100 prisoners are numbered from 1 - 100
100 boxes labelled from 1 - 100 are placed in a room
Each of the prisoner's numbers are written on slips and placed randomly in the boxes, one per box
Each prisoner may enter the room one at a time and check up to 50 boxes
They must leave the room exactly as they found it and can't communicate with the others after
If all 100 prisoners find their number during their turn in the room, they will all be freed. But if even one fails, they will all be executed
The prisoners may strategize before the challenge begins
