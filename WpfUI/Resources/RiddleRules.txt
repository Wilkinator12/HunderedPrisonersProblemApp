100 prisoners are numbered from 1 - 100
Slips with their numbers are randomly placed in 100 boxes in a room
Each prisoner may enter the room one at a time and check up to 50 boxes
They must leave the room exactly as they found it and can't communicate with the others after
If all 100 prisoners find their number during their turn in the room, they will all be freed. But if even one fails, they will all be executed
The prisoners may strategize before the challenge begins
